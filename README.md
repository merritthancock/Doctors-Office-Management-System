# Doctors-Office-Management-System
This was group project for my Software Engineering class in the Fall of 2019. Our prompt for the project was to build a system that allowed different users to perform the day to day tasks you might expect within a doctors office. The system was designed using object oriented programming principles and was written in Java. We also created a JavaFX GUI and a remote relational database that was hosted on Google Cloud.
